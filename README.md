# Beats, Bio, and Code

A little project to share my current FIP Radio groove and a bit about myself. Built with TypeScript, GraphQL, and Yarn. Sandbox.

This project is a revamped evolution of my previous work built using the [NextFIP](https://github.com/Razthevan/NextFIP) and [Spotifip](https://github.com/Razthevan/spotifip) repositories.

## Get it Going

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  `yarn` to get those dependencies.
3.  Add your FIP API credentials.
4.  `yarn dev` to fire it up!
